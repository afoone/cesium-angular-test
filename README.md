- **Leaflet**:
  - Capabilities: Leaflet is primarily a 2D map engine. It supports the addition of plugins like Leaflet-3D, Leaflet-XYZ, or Leaflet.Curve to add certain 3D effects to the maps, but it does not provide a full 3D experience natively.
  - Key Features: Lightweight and easy-to-use library, ideal for simple 2D map applications. Offers a wide range of plugins and has an active developer community. Extensive and high-quality documentation.

- **OpenLayers**:
  - Capabilities: Highly flexible map engine that supports both 2D maps and 3D spherical representations. Can create flat maps or spherical representations using various projections.
  - Key Features: Comprehensive set of features for map application development. Supports multiple projections, integration with web map services, vector layers, 3D data, user interaction, and an extensible API.

- **CesiumJS**:
  - Capabilities: 3D map engine that represents the Earth as a 3D sphere. Displays detailed and accurate 3D spherical maps. Supports visualization of 3D geospatial data such as models, terrains, and point clouds.
  - Key Features: Highly interactive and realistic 3D map experience. Virtual flights, simulation of lighting effects, and atmospheric rendering. Popular for advanced 3D visualizations and geospatial data.

- **Mapbox GL JS**:
  - Capabilities: Map engine focused on 2D map representation, but can simulate 3D spherical representations using visual tricks. Allows for effects like extrusion and shadow to create a 3D appearance in 2D maps.
  - Key Features: Wide variety of customizable styles and layers to create attractive maps. Integration with tile services. Provides a good user experience but has limited 3D capabilities compared to dedicated 3D map engines.
